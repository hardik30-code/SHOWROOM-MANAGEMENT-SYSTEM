PROJECT TITLE- SHOWROOM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.

TEAM NAME-CODING NINJA.

A Java-based program called the Showroom Management System was created to optimize a car dealership's operations. Through the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, the system effectively controls the interactions between vehicles, staff, and the showroom. By offering a single platform for data storage and retrieval, this program minimizes errors and human labor.

Car Management, Employee Management, and Showroom Management are the three main elements that make up the system. Each vehicle's brand, model, year, price, and availability are all stored in detail in the Car Management module. Employee data, including name, ID, role, and contact details, are tracked by the Employee Management module. The location, capacity, and inventory of the showroom are all kept up to date by the Showroom Management module.

The system makes sure that every entity (car, employee, showroom) isolates its own data and behavior by applying OOP concepts like encapsulation. This design is perfect for showrooms of different sizes since it allows for effective data management, scalability, and adaptability.
